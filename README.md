# Library Management System

The Library Management System is a Java-based software application designed to help users manage their personal book collections. It offers various features for adding, removing, and exploring books from both general and personal databases, along with options for rating and reviewing books.

## Features

- *Login Process*: Users can log in using their username and password. If the username doesn't exist, login fails.
- *Registration Process*: New users can register by providing necessary details.
- *Explore General Database*: Users can browse through a general database of books, viewing titles, authors, ratings, and reviews.
- *Access Personal Database*: Users can access their personal database, containing the books they have added, along with personal ratings and reviews.
- *Add and Remove Books*: Admins have the privilege to add or remove books from the general database.
- *User Authentication*: Users can log in or sign up with a username and password. Admins have special privileges.
- *Rating and Review*: Users can rate books and add reviews to books in their personal collection.
- *Data Management*: Allows users to manage their personal data, including reviews and ratings.
- *Intuitive Interface*: User-friendly interface with easy navigation and data entry.
- *Navigable Tables*: Users can smoothly scroll through the tables to view entries without any hassle.
- *Search Bar*: A search bar is provided for quickly finding specific books or authors within the tables.
- *Sortable Columns*: Each column in the tables is sortable, allowing users to organize the data based on their preferences.
- *Sorting Functionality*: Clicking on the "Title" heading in the table sorts the entries by ascending book title order. Clicking again sorts them in descending order, and clicking for the third time restores the original order.

## Frameworks and Libraries

- *Java Swing*: Used for building the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application.
- *JUnit*: Used for unit testing the application components.

## Development Process

The software is developed in Java using Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI). It consists of several classes organized into packages:

- src: Contains the main Java classes for the application.
- data: Contains data files for books and user data.

The development process involved:

1. Designing the class structure to represent books, databases, and user data.
2. Implementing GUI components using Swing for a user-friendly interface.
3. Writing methods to handle database operations such as adding, removing, and loading books.
4. Implementing user authentication and authorization features.
5. Testing and debugging the application to ensure functionality and reliability.
6. Daily group discussions were held to review progress, discuss challenges, and plan tasks.
7. Group members collaborated on coding tasks, shared updates, and made commits to GitHub regularly.
